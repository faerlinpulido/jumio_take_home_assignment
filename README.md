# Jumio Take Home Assignment

This is the take-home challenge for the AI/ML Engineer internship at Jumio. 

## Abstract

We build a classifier on the MNIST dataset. Our classifier is a convolutional neural network with three convolutional layers and one dense layer. With a threshold-based decision strategy, our classifier achieves a maximum false positive rate of 0.00015 for each class in a test set with at least 1000 images per class. The coverage of our decision strategy is 88%.
